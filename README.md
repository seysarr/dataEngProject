### Abstract

Our project aims to recommend healthy recipes according to their benefits and effects on different parts of the body. We also want to include ingredient availability and diet. Here are the different questions we'd like our database to answer:
1: Which recipes are best suited to different regions, taking into account the local availability of ingredients?
2: Which recipes are best for specific health objectives (e.g. improving digestion)?
3: Which recipes are suitable for specific diets (e.g. vegetarian, vegan, gluten-free, low-carb)?
